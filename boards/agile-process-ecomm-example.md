### **Step 1: Define Epics**
**Epics** represent major business objectives. For an e-commerce website, an Epic could be:

- **"Implement Product Catalog and Customer Management"**  
  This captures a large business need and sets a high-level objective. The epic should be broken down to tackle multiple features within this context.

---

### **Step 2: Break Down Epics into Features**
Break the Epic into smaller, manageable **Features** that add functional value. For the Epic above, Features could be:

- **"Develop Product Catalog Module"**  
- **"Build Customer Account Management"**  
- **"Create Shopping Cart and Checkout System"**

Features represent the deliverable parts of the Epic that the team can work on over multiple sprints.

---

### **Step 3: Create User Stories**
**User Stories** describe how an end user will use specific functionalities, written from their perspective. Each Feature is broken into multiple User Stories:

For the **"Develop Product Catalog Module"** feature, we can create:

1. **User Story**: "As a user, I want to view a list of products with descriptions and pricing so that I can select what I need."
2. **User Story**: "As a user, I want to filter products by category, price, and brand, so that I can quickly find items that suit my needs."

Each User Story is small enough to be completed within a single sprint, with a clear end-user goal.

---

### **Step 4: Prioritize Backlog Items**
The **Product Backlog** consists of all User Stories that need to be implemented. Prioritize these backlog items based on business value and customer needs:

- **Top Priority User Story**: "As a user, I want to view a list of products with descriptions and pricing..."
- **Lower Priority User Story**: "As a user, I want to receive recommendations based on my previous purchases..."

High-priority items are pulled into upcoming sprints.

---

### **Step 5: Assign User Stories to Sprints**
Organize work into **Sprints** (typically 1-2 weeks long):

- **Sprint 1**:
  - Develop the product catalog page with product listings and details.
  - Implement search and filtering options.

- **Sprint 2**:
  - Create the customer account management page.
  - Allow customers to register, log in, and view account details.

Each sprint consists of multiple User Stories that need to be completed.

---

### **Step 6: Break User Stories into Tasks**
**Tasks** represent specific work required to complete each User Story. For the User Story "As a user, I want to view a list of products with descriptions and pricing...":

- **Task 1**: "Design product catalog page UI."
- **Task 2**: "Implement API to fetch product details."
- **Task 3**: "Connect front end to back-end services."

Tasks are assigned to developers, and each task is small enough to be completed in a few hours or a day.

---

### **Step 7: Daily Stand-ups & Progress Tracking**
- Conduct **Daily Stand-ups** to track progress, identify blockers, and ensure tasks are on schedule.
- Use **Azure Boards Kanban/Scrum Boards** to visualize progress:
  - **Columns**: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done.
  - Move cards representing **Tasks** across the board as they progress.

This ensures transparency and accountability in the team.

---

### **Step 8: Testing & Bug Tracking**
- During and after each sprint, conduct testing to verify the features.
- **Bugs** are logged as work items in Azure Boards:
  - Example Bug: "Product details page loads too slowly for large product catalogs."
  - Track bugs through the same Kanban board to resolution.

---

### **Step 9: Sprint Review and Retrospective**
- At the end of each **Sprint**, conduct a **Sprint Review** to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders, showcasing the product catalog module.
- Conduct a **Sprint Retrospective** to reflect on what went well and what can be improved in future sprints.

---

### **Step 10: Release Increment**
- After a few sprints, the **Product Catalog Feature** is ready for release.
- Release this feature incrementally, ensuring it delivers value to end-users.

The **Product Catalog Module** (with product listing, filtering, and detailed views) is now available for customer use, fulfilling a core business requirement.
